## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5), for conveying trust, knowledge and focus. A slightly bold, yet practical and familiar hue of blue is well suited to education. Not a fashionable or exciting blue, and certainly not teal.
- Background color: Light blue (#E8EAF6). It shares the hue of the primary color, but is significantly desaturated to provide a gentle, calming backdrop that is easy on the eyes during extended learning sessions.
- Accent color: Purple (#7E57C2). The hue is analogous to the primary color; however, it differs by having much greater brightness and saturation, in order to draw more attention. 
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif for a modern, machined, objective look that promotes clear and neutral readability
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' monospaced sans-serif for clear presentation of code snippets
- Use minimalist, flat icons in blue and white to match the clean aesthetic.
- A clean and intuitive layout to enhance user experience and engagement.
- Subtle animations for interactive elements such as quiz submissions and progress updates.
