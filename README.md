git clone https://github.com/yehia-mohammed-developer/Python-Prep.git
cd Python-Prep
```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
```

### üß† Integration with AI (Genkit)

- **Genkit** is used to organize and manage AI model calls.
- The file `src/ai/flows/explain-code.ts` contains the logic (Flow) that defines how the application interacts with the Gemini model to explain the code.
- The Flow passes user-written code into a specially designed prompt that asks the model to act as an expert Python teacher and provide a simplified explanation.
- GEM key
